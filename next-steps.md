Next steps:
 - validate given and target input for feasibility: 
    * unique car IDs and no missing cars
    * sufficient available tracks (with given hard-coded infrastructure)
 - serde for all three data types
 - unit test for planner using the given example data
 - implement the planner
 - function to simulate a plan execution to validate that it solves the problem
